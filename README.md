## Installation

To run this PHP application locally on your machine, you'll need to have XAMPP installed. Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

- Download XAMPP: If you haven't already, download XAMPP from the official website (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html). Choose the version compatible with your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
- Install XAMPP: Run the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions. During installation, you can choose the components you want to install, but it's recommended to include Apache and MySQL, as these are essential for running PHP applications.
- Start Apache and MySQL: After installation, open the XAMPP Control Panel (usually found in the XAMPP installation directory). Start the Apache and MySQL services by clicking their respective "Start" buttons.
- Clone the Repository: Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine in this root (C:\xampp\htdocs\projetweb\) using the following command: git clone "#git repository url"
- Copy Files to the "htdocs" Directory: Navigate to the XAMPP installation directory (usually located in C:\xampp on Windows, or /Applications/XAMPP/htdocs on macOS). Copy the contents of your cloned repository into the htdocs directory. This is where XAMPP serves web content.
- Database Setup (if applicable): If your PHP application relies on a database, use phpMyAdmin (accessible from the XAMPP Control Panel or with entring the following url : http://localhost/phpmyadmin) to create a database and import any necessary SQL files.
- Access the Application: Open a web browser and enter the following URL: #http://localhost/projetweb/public/index.php
